//! Background clipboard history cleanup worker for the daemon.
//!
//! Runs the daemon's maintenance sweeps on a single shared cadence: once at
//! startup, then every [`CLEANUP_INTERVAL`] until cancelled. Extracted from
//! the ad-hoc `run_file_cache_hygiene` detached task (previously spawned
//! outside the `DaemonService`/`JoinSet` lifecycle) so cleanup is a proper
//! managed service and shuts down cooperatively with the rest of the daemon.
//!
//! Jobs run in a fixed order every tick:
//!
//! 1. **Reconcile** (`reconcile_missing_files`): drop DB entries whose
//!    cache-managed file no longer exists on disk. Must run first — an
//!    entry pointing at a vanished file is exactly the precondition for the
//!    iroh-blobs "poisoned storage" panic once any later step observes the
//!    hash. If reconcile itself fails, the rest of the tick is skipped
//!    entirely rather than risk running the later steps against unreconciled
//!    state.
//! 2. **File-cache cleanup** (`cleanup_expired_files`): the existing
//!    `file_sync.*`-driven TTL sweep + disk quota enforcement.
//! 3. **Retention policy** (`enforce_retention_policy`): the user-configured
//!    `retention_policy` age/count rules, applied across the full clipboard
//!    history (not just disk-backed entries).
